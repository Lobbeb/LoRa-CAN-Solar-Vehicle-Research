📡 LoRa-CAN Solar Vehicle Research

🚗☀️ Optimizing Communication and Energy Efficiency in IoT for Solar-Powered Cars
By William Olsson & Ruben Croall


📌 Overview
This research investigates the feasibility of LoRa (Long Range) technology for real-time Controller Area Network (CAN) bus telemetry in solar-powered vehicles. The study focuses on:

Energy efficiency 🔋: Measuring power consumption of ESP32 with LoRa.
Packet loss analysis 📶: Evaluating LoRa's reliability over distances up to 125 meters.
Signal strength optimization 📡: Testing different spreading factors (SF), bandwidths (SBW), and transmission settings.
This work contributes to the Halmstad University Solar Team (HUST) and aligns with the World Solar Challenge (WSC), where energy-efficient telemetry is critical for race strategy and vehicle optimization.
